# SoundCloud-API-App-Project

This project uses the SoundCloud API to pull the track, track name, track art, and track URL data. It is authenticated on the client-side with SoundCloud's JavaScript SDK. A user can search for whatever artists they like and cards will be generated that correspond to that artist. The user can also create a custom playlist which is kept using local storage. A clear playlist button allows the user to clear the playlist and storage.
